# gol-screensaver
visual part of a screensaver written in c. will probably only work on macos.

used on my laptop in conjunction with a piece of software called "sleepwatcher" to act as an event caller; open and close it when inactive/resume

also missing macros for keystrokes that would make the window fullscreen and sized properly
